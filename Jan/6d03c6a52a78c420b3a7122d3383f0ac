At midday today the station’s Neil Bisseker told Grocott’s Mail this morning’s updated report still applied. Algoa FM reported that PE fire-fighting teams were keeping an eye on the fire and that initial plans to evacuate the SANCCOB Penguin Rescue Station were put on hold because of a change in wind direction.
