Over the past week 18 932 users engaged with our posts (Liking, Commenting and Sharing), keeping us active on our page and making sure our readers get the most up to date news as possible. We have our ears on the ground and our journalists are always out and about making sure to bring you the news as it unfolds. Facebook rates us as 90% responsive to messages and comments. Even though we understand how the Facebook ‘popularity’ algorithm works, our loyal readers always make sure to read and share our posts, putting our stories at the top of user newsfeeds. Over the last week our website had over 7 100 user visits, that opened 8 300 sessions, reading and viewing our pages. Our top story (Rhodes warns of water shutdown) has 3 128 page views. Our strongest referrals come from Facebook and direct website visits; most users find us through their mobile devices, meaning they access our website anywhere and anytime. Our team is incredibly proud of this milestone, and looks forward to continuing to serve our community for many more ‘likes’ and ‘shares’ to come.
