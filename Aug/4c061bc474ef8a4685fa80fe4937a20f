With less than two weeks to go until the end of the 2019 Round Table Winter Knights collection, the support for the campaign so far has been excellent – and there is still time to do more. Project Convenor, Greg Wilmot, reported the expansion of the campaign to nine Collection Points with SAIAB (located on Somerset Street) and the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology at Rhodes University being the two new additions. The various Collection Points dotted around the town were reporting that their bins are overflowing, said Wilmot, who is excited at the prospect of a bumper collection. The Collection Points at SAIAB, Rhodes University, and Sirenskyscraper Dance Studio have all called for assistance to empty their bins and are reporting that more donations from colleagues and the public continue to flow in. Grahamstown Round Table 11 launched their Winter Knights collection campaign on Thursday 18 July 2019 and it will run for the duration of Mandela Month until 18 August. The Collection Points are located at the following venues:
