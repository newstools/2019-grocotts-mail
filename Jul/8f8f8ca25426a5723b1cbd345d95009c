Photo: Lynette Rudman A beautiful white calf has been given a second chance after being freed from a nasty snare this past Sunday 21 July. Makhanda (Grahamstown) resident Lynette Rudman was out birding near the army base when she came across the injured calf. Thanks to Ikhala Veterinary Clinic and the SPCA, this precious youngster is back on its feet.
