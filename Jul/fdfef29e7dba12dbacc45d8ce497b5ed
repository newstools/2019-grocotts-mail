Eric Nabo with a few cabbages in his garden. Eric Nabo is been planting vegetables in his garden, for the past for four years since losing his job. Unemployed, his garden is his means of survival. “There is no work to be found, so I try to survive through my garden,” he says. He has planted sweet potatoes and cabbages. He would appreciate if he can get some seeds, because, he has plenty of space to grow food.
