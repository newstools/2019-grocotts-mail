For this year’s National Arts Festival, Grocott’s Mail is bringing our readers a family-friendly activity guide; jam-packed with show suggestions, free performances and exhibitions as well as helpful tips for keeping the family safe and happy. It’s hard to pack all remaining 9 days into one newspaper, so we’ve picked some highlights and recommendations that we think our readers (and their kids) would enjoy! Remember, prior booking for tickets is necessary, and tipping of the street performers and buskers is encouraged! Did somebody say FREE? There’s lots of entertainment at Fest that requires no ticket to enter! Check out these great options: The Standard Bank Village Green The extensive Village Green is packed with food and drink stalls, arts, crafts and trinkets for sale, as well as some amazing buskers and performers. All the performances are free, but tipping is highly encouraged. Buskers at National Arts Festival 2018.

The KZN Youth Orchestra Children’s Concert @ 1 FOUNTAIN FOYER, 30 JUNE 13:00 Makhanda’s weather can change quite quickly, so make sure you and the family are dressed appropriately. Keep a light sweater on hand for the day and a heavier coat and scarf for the evenings, but don’t skimp on sunscreen! Walking around this beautiful town can take its toll and nobody wants a sunburn over Festival!The temperature highs will range from 16 to 22, while the lows from 5 to 7. Sun is expected for most of the Festival with a few clouds peeking out to say ‘hello’ on occasion. Rain might happen on Monday, but given the drought, this community welcomes every single drop! Oh, and be sure to pack a reusable water bottle and eco-friendly coffee cup! Most coffee shops will give customers a slight discount if you bring your own cup! A nifty tip for any visiting coffee-connoisseurs. Grocott’s Mail wishes everyone an exciting and fun Festival, and encourages and reminds residents and visitors to save water, keep rubbish in designated bins, and most importantly, smile!
