Buskers at the Village Green are one of the many free family activities during National Arts Festival. Photo by Jan Potgieter The weather is shaping up to be a beautiful day in Makhanda (Grahamstown), with sunny conditions and a high of 22 and a low of 4. If you aren’t from Makhanda, be sure to pack a light sweater for the mornings and late afternoons, and a heavy coat and scarf for the evenings. But don’t skimp on the sunglasses and sunscreen for the kids! Just because it’s winter doesn’t mean the sun can’t take it’s toll, especially on the kids! To start your day, take a stroll through The Standard Bank Village Green; the Village Green is filled with food, arts and crafts stalls as well as a plethora of free performances fit for the whole family. All the performances are free (but please do tip the performers as generously as you’re able), and leaves plenty of opportunity to grab a coffee (for the adults) and a cold drink for the kids. The Village Green opens at 9am daily and performances finish by 6pm. KIDS’ RECOMMENDED SHOWS!
