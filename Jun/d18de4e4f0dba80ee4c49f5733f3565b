We are working closely with other National, Provincial and Local stakeholders through the safety and events committee platform to ensure that our guests and local community feel safe.” Road Blocks and vehicle checkpoints will be held to ensure the safety of the community and our festival goers. Air support would also be on standby for the duration of the event. The following static points have been established to provide easy access for enquiries and reports.
