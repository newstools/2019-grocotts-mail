She has been planting for the past ten years, as a way to make sure that she can get the food that she needs.Â Being unemployed, Maholo said that food is very expensive to buy, which is why she plants. Recently Maholo has reaped potatoes and carrots and she has planted tomatoes in her garden, but would appreciate if she can be assisted by seeds so that she can continue to grow a healthy crop for her and her family.
