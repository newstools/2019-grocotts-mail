Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle visited Makhanda (Grahamstown) on 17 April to lead a task team assessing progress in the municipality with drought intervention initiatives. This comes as more than R880 million has been distributed to various municipalities across the province, including R22 million for Makana’s water service infrastructure. Masualle had stern criticism for Makana, and called for urgent and immediate action. “If you have R20 to do everything, you have to work out what you can do with it. We can’t live beyond our means – we have to find creative ways to be self-reliant. We need the community to subscribe to the same vision of a viable Makana. You want this municipality to be able to stand by itself.” -Masualle
