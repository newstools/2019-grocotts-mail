Lukhanyo Mqoki in his garden Lukhanyo Maqoki started planting in 2018. Without much money to buy food, Maqoki plants vegetables to feed himself.Â  He also believes that vegetables are a major source of food that is needed everyday. He takes what is in the garden and mixes it with other food in order to eat. Maqoki saves water in a 2L bottle for the days that there is no water for his garden. He has planted spinach, beetroot, green paper, onions, and peas. Maqoki would be grateful for seeds to continue planting.
