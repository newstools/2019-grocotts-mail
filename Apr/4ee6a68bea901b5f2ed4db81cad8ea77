Social Development MEC Dr Pumza Dyantyi, together with other government leaders, are visiting Lusikisiki today Thursday 4 April 2019 following faction fights between Sicambeni and Zitha villagers, the MEC for Social Development said in a media release. Simmering tensions had led to the torching of 28 homesteads last weekend, leaving over 200 people displaced. The conflict was reported to be around village boundaries. “Violence due to the fights has disintegrated families and resulted in the death of one person,” Dyantyi said. So far, the displaced villagers had been placed in the local church hall. Mainly women and children had been caught in the crossfire. “We call for the immediate cessation of hostilities so as to ensure a safe passage of children and women. War and conflict have an unbearable effect on families – especially on children. It creates invisible wounds, while on the other side stealing their childhood,” said Dyantyi. Dyantyi has dispatched officials to provide relief support to the displaced villagers and a multi-stakeholder team has been set up for mediation.
