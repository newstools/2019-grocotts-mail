Zongezile Dyeshana in his garden. Zongezile Dyeshana is a grandfather who loves the garden. He has been planting since he was young. Another thing that encourages him to plant is that he does not like moving around, he prefers to work in his garden. He sells his vegetables to community members. He has planted spinach, onion and potatoes. Dyeshana would appreciate it if he could be blessed with more seeds so that he can continue planting.
