Last week the Municipal Council sat and deliberated on a number of crucial issues pertaining to the performance of the municipality. Among the items that were discussed was the matter of an unfunded budget. The 2019/2020 budget adopted by the municipality in July was unfunded by R109m. Section 18(i) of the Municipal Finance Management Act state that a “municipal budget must be funded from realistically anticipated revenue, cash backed accumulated funds”. Accordingly, National Treasury instructed Makana Municipality to review its budget and adopt a fully funded budget or risk the withdrawal of its equitable share which is due in December. In this regard, National Treasury instructed the municipality to: In short, our operating budget needs to be cut to ensure that it is within our revenue generation budget. The CFO and his team worked tirelessly and reprioritised and came up with a fully funded budget. A special council meeting this week will adopt the revised fully funded budget for the 2019/2020 financial year. At the same council meeting, council will adopt a comprehensive Financial Recovery Plan. Among other matter discussed at last week’s full council meeting was the matter of unspent grant funding. During the previous financial year our municipality spent 50% of its allocated grant funding. This amounted to R47.4m. Our Municipality applied to the National Treasury for a roll-over for the incomplete projects. National Treasury approved a rollover of R43.5m, with only R3.9m not approved. The municipality intends to appeal this rejected amount. The following projects were approved by the National Treasury: The approval of these rollover applications by National Treasury means as the municipality we shall be able to complete the projects that we have started.
