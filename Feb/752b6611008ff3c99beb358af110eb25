The Lebone Centre recently celebrated World Read Aloud Day by having staff members and Project Read volunteers read to approximately 600 children in Grahamstown. This year’s story, written for the Nal’ibali campaign by Ann Walton, was entitled “Where are you?” and was read in three different languages (Afrikaans, isiXhosa, and English), depending on the audience. The schools that were visited included Grahamstown Primary, George Dickerson Primary, St Mary’s Primary, Heidi Pre-Primary, Sun City Preschool and a few smaller preschools in the area. Staff dressed up for the occasion and special storyboards were drawn by Chanelle Staude, a local artist and Project Read volunteer. Country-wide, Nal’ibali succeeded in their aim of reading to over 1.5 million children on World Read Aloud Day.
