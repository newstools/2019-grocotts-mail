The Ndlovu rhino-poaching trial will resume in the High Court in Makhanda (Grahamstown) on Monday 11 March, for argument and possible judgment. Jabulani Ndlovu, Forget Ndlovu and Sikhumbuzo Ndlovu were arrested at Makana Resort outside Makhanda in June 2016. They are charged with counts of theft, contravening environmental laws and the Medicines Control Act, and contravening the Firearms Control Act in connection with 13 poaching incidents near Makhanda, Jansenville, Graaff-Reinet, Cradock and Alexandria. Senior Counsel for the defence, Terry Price, informed Judge Jeremy Pickering that his clients had run out of funds and that on the basis he had been on the case thus far, would see it through to its conclusion on a pro bono basis. Judge Pickering said the case should be set down for argument and possibly judgment in the week starting 11 March.
