Nicholas Scarr (N.Scarr@ru.ac.za) The Public Service Accountability Monitor (PSAM) conducted comprehensive analyses of the 2012/13 – 2015/16 budgets of the Chief Directorate: Environmental Affairs of the Eastern Cape Department of Economic Development, Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism (DEDEAT), and published brief reviews of the Chief Directorate’s 2017/18 and 2018/19  budgets. The complexion of the Chief Directorate’s budget remained essentially unchanged from 2012/13 to 2018/19, and for the 2019/20 financial year the situation is no different. The 2019/20 budget of DEDEAT as a whole has increased by a significant 27,0%, relative to its 2018/19 adjusted appropriation, but 92,9% of this increase has  been allocated to the Department’s Economic Development Programme, thereby raising its budget by 47,8%. In contrast, Environmental Affairs’ budget was increased by a more modest 7,4%, while the budget of the  Department’s Administration Programme decreased by 3,9%. In these circumstances, the summary of PSAM’s key findings in relation to Environmental Affairs’ budgets for the 2012/13 – 2018/19 financial years, as captured in its 2018/19 budget review, is equally applicable to the Chief Directorate’s 2019/20 budget, bar for a minor adjustment to reflect that whereas the Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency had until 2018/19 consistently accounted for between 65 and 70% of the Chief Directorate’s allocation, its share of the 2019/20 budget is  62%. The adjusted summary of key findings, together with enduring recommendations associated with these findings, is included below. Key findings Recommendations
