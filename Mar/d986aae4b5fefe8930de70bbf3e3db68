Three men facing the charge of attempted murder will make their second appearance in the Magistrate’s Court in Makhanda (Grahamstown) on 4 March. The charge is in connection with a shooting incident that, according to a source, took place on Saturday 23 February outside the Joza Police Station. Sources later that day told Grocott’s Mail that the man who was shot was recovering in hospital, having been airlifted for emergency surgery. On Saturday, following the incident, police and private security intervened when a large group of supporters of the hospitalised man confronted a family member of the alleged shooter. They did this outside the family member’s Beaufort Street business. A group of around 50 people protested on Monday 25 February outside the court, opposing bail for the three accused. Inside the court, Magistrate Ntsoki Moni heard that none of the men had pending cases or previous convictions. However, she set down 4 March for their bail application in order to obtain an interpreter for the first accused. The men indicated they had a private attorney. Grocott’s Mail has so far not been able to obtain further detail or confirmation from the police and will continue to report. Grocott’s Mail will not identify the men because they have not pleaded.
