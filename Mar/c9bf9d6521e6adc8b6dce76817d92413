A cold front will reach Port Elizabeth in the afternoon, bringing with it overnight showers south of the escarpment and west of Queenstown. Friday 08/03/2019:
A ridging high will push in rain and showers in over areas south of the escarpment (that is areas south of Graaff-Reinet and Queenstown). Rainfall south of Darlington dam may reach 10mm in places overnight. Saturday 09/03/2019: 
With the high maintaining its position, together with an upper trough drawing moisture in over the region, it will continue raining with light to moderate showers expected south of Darlington Dam, with rainfall 10-15mm in places.  Afternoon thunderstorms are expected along the escarpment, spreading to the Wild coast later in the day. Rainfall over the eastern half of the province is expected to be between 10 and 15 mm. Sunday10/03/2019:
An upper low develops west of the country, with a high south of the country, resulting in clearance from the west. However, the Tropical moisture will assist in the development of thundershowers and showers in the east. Monday 11/03/2019:
The upper low moves closer to the country, with showers and thundershowers developing over the Northern Cape, moving over the Eastern Cape in the afternoon.
